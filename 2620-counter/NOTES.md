- function in javascript can returned from function because **functions** in javascript is **first class** that mean can be assigned to variable , passed as an argument to function
or returned like the example ,
​
- but function not returned only but it is returned with it is lexical scope and this called **Clousre**
- instead of createCounter is invoked and poped from call stack
-  returend function that stored in counter variable still have access to n variable
-  and can be updated or only log it
